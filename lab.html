        Icons, though a small aspect, can significantly contribute to improving the overall experience of the users, allowing them to navigate with ease and help achieve their purpose for using the application. Having a consistent and recognizable balance poses a challenge for designers.

        At the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the preexisting iconography set became a visual setback for users for the following reasons:
        <ol class="increased-height">
          <li>The lack of consistency of icons contribute to an unpleasant experience.</li>
          <li>The set of icons are not curated and clash with each other.</li>
          <li>The thickness of the icons draw the users’ eyes away from the overall experience.</li>

        Cornell Lab of Ornithology lacked a cohesive visual language which resulted in a poor user experience as it weakened the brand.

              Elliot Thomas is a third-year studying Biology at Cornell University. He was interested in avian biology and conservation as a kid, however, failed to find an Ornithology major at Cornell. As a result, he actively takes part in the Cornell Birding Club to connect with local birding opportunities, however, wanted to connect to applications that matched his interests. He came across Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s website and later their applications, Merlin and Ebird, and despite a well functioning application, found the design to be outdated and unclear.

            In order to have scaleable icons, I opted to design icons on a 24 x 24px grid. Through my research, I found numerous articles that stated that icons work best in sizes 16px, 20px , 24px and 32px, stressing the importance of keeping a clear and recognizable icon that worked well in different sizes.

          <div class="proposal-desc-bot">
            By following the grid shown on the left, the determined goal is to create a consistent and modern set of icons

        The team discussed that they envisioned a set more consistent and lightweight. With this information, I was tasked with the direction and execution of the entire project. I analyzed that the preexisting set had differing line weights, causing clashing between icons within the same set.  I aimed to shift the clunky, heavy, and outdated appearance and display a clearer message. The line width and roundness on the corners would both be 2px to create a more fuller, and inviting look. I began designing icons in #212121 (off black) and then created other color variations for different platforms.
