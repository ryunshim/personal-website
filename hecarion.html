                        decrease. Students find themselves staying on-campus until buses start running again or walk

                                    Engineering. He lives a ten minute walk away off-campus and primary modes of
                                    transportation are walking or busing.
                                    He has a determined attitude about life and believes that with enough effort and
                                    hard work, anything is achievable. He values his safety, and takes on
                                    responsibility not only for himself but especially for his loved ones.
